    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Due to my career I do enjoy working out and being active.  Playing basketball, lifitng weights, and going for walks when it's not cold outside.</p>
    <p> I enjoy lerning about red team, pentesting, and incident response as well.  I take alot of classes just to expand my skillset</p>
    <p> I do play Xbox from time to time but when I am in school and learning I do not have much time to play as much as I wish I could play more.</p>
    <p> Lastly, I enjoy having a cigar.  I recently got into it and it's very relaxing and enjoyable.  It gives me time to refelct and meditate</p>
